John and I were both POWs, and I know he has an unshakeable character and unwavering dedication to country; always putting country above himself. That is why Virginia's Veterans are organizing and enthusiastically dedicating our time and effort to helping him win in November. We believe John McCain will be the best Commander-in-Chief that this nation has seen in a generation."In Virginia Beach today, Veteran for McCain Vice Admiral Hank Giffin, said, "In the world we live in today, we need a leader like John McCain who has extensive national security and foreign policy experience. He is a leader who will work with our allies to secure a more peaceful world. With John McCain as Commander-in-Chief, we will make substantial progress in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The course Barack Obama advocates would weaken our security and could put peace further out of reach. Our nation will be strengthened with John McCain as President and Commander-in-Chief."Senator McCain served for 22 years in the U.S. Navy, including 5 1/2 years as a POW, and was commander of the largest attack squadron in the Navy.
