GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of Michigan Veterans for John McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within Michigan's veterans' community. With more than 175 members representing all service branches, the group's membership spans generations, including veterans from World War II to the combat operations in Operation Enduring Freedom."Veterans back John McCain because he always backs us. From working tirelessly to improve veterans' health care to streamlining VA services, Senator McCain clearly understands that our nation is forever indebted to those who served in our nation's armed forces," said Hank Fuhs, Co-Chair of Michigan Veterans for John McCain. "McCain's strong support extends to those who are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. While his opponent has played politics with troop funding, John McCain continues to fight for our servicemen and women while also working to ease their transition back to civilian life."McCain's campaign announced the leadership of Michigan Veterans for John McCain on Monday at a press event in Grand Rapids that featured Rob Deane, Claude McManus and Andrew "Rocky" Raczkowski, Both Dr. Deane and Claude McManus served in the U.S. Navy as a Captain and Command Master Chief, respectively.
