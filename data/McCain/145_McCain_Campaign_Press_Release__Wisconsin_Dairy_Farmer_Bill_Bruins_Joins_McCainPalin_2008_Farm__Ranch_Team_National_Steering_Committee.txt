ARLINGTON, VA -- Today McCain-Palin 2008 announced that Bill Bruins, a dairy farmer from Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, joined the McCain-Palin Farm & Ranch Team National Steering Committee. Bruins joins a distinguished team of elected officials and leaders in agriculture who share a common goal with John McCain: to provide the leadership necessary to create prosperity in America's rural heartland."John McCain understands agriculture's need for a comprehensive national energy policy that will combat rising energy costs," Bruins said. "I support John McCain because he will foster greater opportunities for agriculture to thrive in a market-driven society by reducing taxes and government regulations. Most importantly, he understands that reducing trade barriers expands international commerce and increases farmers' income."In addition to serving on the McCain-Palin Farm and Ranch Team National Steering Committee, Bruins joins former Wisconsin Secretary of Agriculture Jim Harsdorf as a Wisconsin state co-chair on the Wisconsin McCain-Palin Farm & Ranch Team."Bill's understanding of agriculture from both state and national public policy involvement makes him a great addition to the McCain-Palin team in Wisconsin," Harsdorf said. "Bill Bruins is a hands-on dairy and crop producer who understands the importance of John McCain's support for free trade, his commitment to reducing the inheritance and capital gains tax on farmers and his plan to reduce high energy costs by pursuing domestic energy sources."The continuing success of American agriculture and the health of America's rural heartland require a leader who understands that productivity and innovation are created by the effort, ingenuity and investment of individual Americans. As president, John McCain will address the key issues facing agriculture and rural America:Establishing a comprehensive energy strategyControlling taxation and regulationJudicial restraint and preserving property rightsProviding a sustainable, market-driven risk management system for farmersPromoting agricultural markets and reducing trade barriersImproving incentives to invest in technology and rural infrastructureEncouraging common-sense conservation and food safety measuresSecuring America's borders and implementing a fair and practical immigration policyRecognizing the role of agriculture in national securityStrengthen America's economic competitiveness by eliminating wasteful government spendingThe benefits of American leadership in agriculture extend well beyond our borders -- America's contribution to meeting the food, fiber, feed and energy needs of a growing world population through efficient production and technology innovation are critical to our national security.More details on John McCain's statement on "Prosperity for Rural America" can be found on the McCain-Palin 2008 web site atrural.JohnMcCain.com.MCCAIN-PALIN 2008 FARM & RANCH TEAM NATIONAL STEERING COMMITTEE*Co-ChairsFormer U.S. Secretary of Agriculture John Block, IllinoisU.S. Senator Sam Brownback, KansasU.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, GeorgiaU.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte, VirginiaU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, South CarolinaU.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, IowaFourth Generation Missouri Farmer Charlie KruseFormer U.S. Deputy Secretary of Agriculture James Moseley, IndianaU.S. Representative Adam Putnam, FloridaSteering Committee MembersNorth Dakota Farm Bureau Eric AasmundstadFormer Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture and State Senator Don AmentLouisiana Farm Bureau President Ronnie AndersonWashington Farm Bureau President Steve AppelArmstrong Farms Owner Jay Armstrong, KansasMissouri Governor Matt BluntU.S. Representative Roy Blunt, MissouriU.S. Senator Kit Bond, MissouriKansas Farm Bureau President Steve BaccusGeorgia Agribusiness Council President Gary BlackFlorida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Charles H.
