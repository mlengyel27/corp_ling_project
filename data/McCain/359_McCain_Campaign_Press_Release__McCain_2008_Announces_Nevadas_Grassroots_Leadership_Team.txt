LAS VEGAS, NV -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced Nevada's Grassroots Leadership Team. This team of local Nevada leaders will help organize and manage the campaign's grassroots efforts, including the "Get-Out-The-Vote" turnout operation, in each county and city across the State of Nevada."John McCain is a true 'Maverick;' he is independent-minded and we can count on him to do what is right for our Nation, not just what is politically popular at the moment," said Lt. Governor Brian Krolicki, John McCain Nevada Campaign Chairman. "His character and his record speak for themselves. Nevadans can look forward to a stronger, more prosperous America with John McCain in the White House.""John McCain has provided a comprehensive, real world energy plan and he will fight to end our dependence on foreign oil. At the same time, he will implement a simpler, fairer tax plan that will help put money back in the pockets of Nevadans across the state."Nevada's 17 counties will have a designated chairman at the local level to serve as the points of contact for local volunteers and supporters, and to help communicate John McCain's message of country first, national security, stronger economy and government reform.
