ARLINGTON, VA -- Today over 100 prominent Catholics nationwide have come together to support John McCain for president. The National Catholics for McCain Committee, led by U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Former Governor Frank Keating (R-OK), is growing rapidly. The group is represented by elected officials, businessmen and women, grassroots organizers, students, and Catholic leaders from over two dozen states."John McCain has a common sense vision for America based on faith, freedom, and families," said Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), National Co-Chair of the National Catholics for McCain Committee. "Committed to the protection of innocent human life, he is a leader Catholics will be proud to support. John McCain knows from experience what it means when a society tramples on the truth of the value of the human person. He is committed to defending the dignity and value of every person, regardless of their status."John McCain expressed his deep appreciation and stated, "I want to thank Catholic voters today, who have played a vital role in electing me as the Republican nominee for the presidency. I am humbled by the support of such a diverse group of Catholic leaders who are dedicated to the defense of traditional marriage, advocate for the protection of innocent human life, and share my vision for a stronger, safer and more prosperous America. I stand firmly with those Catholics who believe that human rights are natural rights for all people, in all places, and in all stages of life."The National Catholics for McCain Committee is actively recruiting Catholics at the national, regional, state, local, and parish levels to help share John McCain's vision and pro-Catholic message.Catholics For McCain Co-Chairs:U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, KansasFormer Governor Frank Keating, OklahomaCatholics For McCain National Leadership Committee:Republican House Leader John Boehner, OhioFormer U.S. Senator Mike DeWine, OhioRepresentative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, FloridaRepresentative Mario Diaz-Balart, FloridaFormer U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Washington, DCRepresentative Ray LaHood, IllinoisRepresentative Dan Lungren, CaliforniaU.S. Senator Mel Martinez, FloridaRepresentative Jean Schmidt, OhioRepresentative Pat Tiberi, OhioCatholics For McCain National Steering Committee:David Adams, Florida, Retired Senior Foreign Service OfficerLaurence Alvarado, Florida, Managing Director, Bearing Point & Contributor, InsideCatholic.comHon.
