GREEN BAY, WI -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of Wisconsin Veterans for John McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within Wisconsin's veterans' community. Wisconsin Veterans for John McCain includes members representing the large majority of counties in Wisconsin and veterans from multiple conflicts including current combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan."John McCain had the courage and foresight to call for the change in strategy that has succeeded in Iraq. He did so at great political risk and was criticized by Republicans, Democrats and the press," said Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, Honorary Chair of Wisconsin Veterans for John McCain. "Our progress would be lost if Barack Obama had his way and withdrew our forces without concern for conditions on the ground or the advice of our commanders. In opposing the surge for purely political reasons, Barack Obama put his own self-interest ahead of the safety and security of our troops. Unlike his opponent, John McCain would rather lose an election than lose a war."McCain's campaign announced the leadership of Wisconsin Veterans for John McCain today at a press event in Green Bay that featured State Senate Minority Leader Lt.

Scott Fitzgerald, USAR, former State Treasurer Jack Voight, former Sergeant, U.S. Army, and Captain Daniel Buttery, U.S. Army (Ret.), a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom.WISCONSIN VETERANS FOR JOHN MCCAIN LEADERSHIP TEAMState Co-ChairsColonel Raymond Boland, U.S. Army (Ret.)Captain Daniel Buttery, U.S. Army (Ret.)Major Scott Southworth, USARJack Voight, U.S. ArmyCoalition MembersTommy Anderson, USAFRick BaasRoger Bardoel, USAFDennis Bloomen, U.S. ArmyMichael Borg, USAFJason BuchenJoseph Burclaw, ANGDave Carter, U.S. ArmyJeffrey Case, U.S. ArmyPatrick Collins, USNSteven Constine, U.S. ArmySteven Conto, USNRoger Cross, USNTim Diedrich, U.S. ArmyTimothy Donahue, U.S. ArmyDaniel DoughtyMichael Eibs, ANGDel Ellefson, USNPeter Erkkila, USAFMitchell Ferguson, USAFSteven Gallion, U.S. ArmyIan Handley, U.S. ArmyRandall HansenDaniel HeiligerDan Hensel, U.S. ArmyRichard Hood, USNClinton LeClair, USAFCarson LundeDale McNamee, U.S. ArmyJohn Murphy, USNGerald Nelson, U.S. ArmySteven Oreck, USMCWilliam Parzyszek, U.S. ArmyRussell Peck, USMCDonald Pedersen, USARCory Peplinski, USMCAlan Probst, USARGordon Sailer, USAFThomas Sharratt, U.S. ArmyStanley Tanner, USMCRon Tikalsky, USNJohn TownsendMaria TownsendBrittney Tran, USMCChristian Walters, U.S. ArmyChallis Wilson, USAFMichael Witt, USAR
