OREGON CITY, OR -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced Oregon's Grassroots Leadership Team. This team of local Oregon leaders will help organize and manage the campaign's grassroots efforts, including the "get out the vote" turnout operation, in each county and city across the state of Oregon.Each of Oregon's 36 counties will have a designated chairman at the local level to serve as the point of contact for local volunteers and supporters, and to help communicate John McCain's message of country first, national security, stronger economy and government reform."John McCain has proven throughout his life that putting our great country first will be the guiding principle that defines his administration," said former Oregon Governor Victor Atiyeh. "McCain's unquestioned bipartisan approach to finding solutions to the tough issues facing Oregonians today is refreshing in a time of unmitigated partisanship and gridlock in Washington."Gov. Atiyeh continued, "Through our strong and diverse leadership team we will be able to effectively drive a message of low taxes, stimulating the economy and genuine answers to health care concerns. John McCain has a bold, principled plan to help America move forward without bowing to ever-changing political winds. Oregon deserves a strong president that rises above petty partisanship and puts country first."OREGON GRASSROOTS LEADERSHIP TEAMStatewide ChairmanVictor Atiyeh, Former GovernorHonorary Co-ChairsGreg Walden, CongressmanBob Smith, CongressmanDenny Smith, CongressmanJason Atkinson, State SenatorTed Ferrioli, Senate Minority LeaderBruce Hanna, House Minority LeaderJackie Winters, St ate SenatorVance Day, Oregon Republican ChairmanRon Maurer, State RepresentativeGordon Sondland, CEO Provenance HotelsRon Saxton, former Republican Nominee for GovernorCongressional District ChairsSally Stevens, 1st Congressional District ChairCheri Adkins, 2nd Congressional District ChairDick Osborne, 3rd Congressional District ChairPatt Farr, 4th Congressional District ChairLynn Snodgrass, 5th Congressional District ChairOregon County ChairsClatsopJohn VeenendaalColumbiaFred YauneyWashingtonBeau McNeffYamhillNeal LockhartHood RiverBrian SteevesTom YatesWascoGeorgia MurrayShermanErnie MooreJeffersonLou DobbinsGilliamLarry LearMorrowNeva DeMayoUmatillaRudy Stefancik, MDBill HansellUnionLanny HildebrantWallowaGeorge BallardWheelerFreda YoakamBakerBill GastJeremy GilpinDeschutesLee SmithGrantKing WilliamsCrookSeth CrawfordJacksonWarren MerzRuth BroadmanKlamathJoe SpendolliniLakeJane O'KeefeHarneySue RamsayMalheurJune HartleyMultnomahLisa SullivanBentonStella GuentherLinnMary GrimesCoosAndy JacksonDouglasFred DaytonJosephineBill ErtelRichard SmithCurryWarren GlazeLaneKaye RidleyLincolnWes ChadwickTilamookRoger TraceyMarionGreg LeoClackamasMarjorie HughesLinda NeacePolkPaul Knobel
