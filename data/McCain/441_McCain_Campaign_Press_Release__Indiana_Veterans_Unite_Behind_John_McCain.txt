INDIANAPOLIS, IN -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of Indiana Veterans for McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within Indiana's veterans' community. With 150 members representing all service branches, the group's membership spans generations, including veterans from World War II to the combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan."John McCain's distinguished service in the United States Navy is a matter of record and there is no doubting his sacrifice for America as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. His history of putting his country first, from Hanoi to Washington, stands in stark contrast to Barack Obama's record, which reflects a willingness to ignore the facts and say whatever it takes to further his political career," said Congressman Steve Buyer, Co-Chair of Indiana Veterans for McCain. "Veterans back John McCain because he always backs us. From working tirelessly to improve veterans' health care to streamlining VA services, Senator McCain clearly understands that our nation is forever indebted to those who served in our nation's armed forces."David Mann, a U.S. Naval Reservist, added: "McCain's strong support of our country's military family extends to those who are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. While his opponent has played politics with troop funding, John McCain continues to fight for our servicemen and women while also working to ease their transition back to civilian life. At a time when fewer and fewer Americans know what it is like to serve in our armed forces, Senator McCain's experience will be immeasurable when he is elected president."McCain's campaign announced the leadership of Indiana Veterans for McCain on Wednesday at a press event in Indianapolis that featured Congressman Steve Buyer, Mayor Greg Ballard, Lt. Gen. Carol Mutter, USMC (Ret.) and Rex Early and David Mann. Lieutenant General Carol Mutter is the first woman in the United States Armed Forces promoted to a three-star rank.INDIANA VETERANS FOR JOHN MCCAIN LEADERSHIP TEAMState Chairs:David Mann, USNRCongressman Steve Buyer, USARState Co-Chairs:Mayor Greg Ballard, USMCLieutenant General Carol Mutter, USMC (Ret.)Rex Early, USMC (Ret.)Robert Vane, USATodd Young, USMCSteve ShortCoalition MembersBobby Albertson, USANGJoseph Austin, Jr., USANGJerry Aytes Jr., USARichard Barger, USNRMichael Bevers, USMCJessie Beyrer, USMCKevin Bouma, USAGary Bowser, USN, USAFRoger Bradley, USAJames Brassell, USMCMargie Breeden, USALawrence Buell, USAPatrick Burns, NGDavid Burton, USNNorman Campbell, USAFStephen Campbell , USAPaul CauleyDavid Cederholm, USNRobert Cline, USANGGerald Cohron, USNG, USMCBrian Cole, USNDan Cole, USAJeffrey Cole, USAEd Coleman, USNWilliam Collins, US USAKenneth Cooper, USANGChris Crabtree, USNDavid Cremeans, USARandolph Damm, USAR-R, USNRobin Davis, USAFJames Deckard, USNKen Dennis, USAFMatthew DeWolfe, USMCRobert Dickerson, USALouis Dissinger, USADavid Dupee, USNRobert Durgin, USMCForrest Durnal, USACharles Eaton, USAJeremy Echerd, USAGeorge Ellwood, USNKevin Etzkorn, USNChristopher Faulkner, USMCStephen Fay, USNRichard Fero, USAJohn Fischer, USADavid Franklin, USA, USARChristopher Frantz, USNJohn Freeman, USAFDave Galloway, USA, USARTerry Gerhart, USATheodore Gerst , USAFRhonda Godlewski, USABrian Goodknight, USAGregory Gossman, USAFMichael Griffey, USADennis Grove, USARAnthony Hand, USARuss Hernandez, USAFJohn Hickman II, USAJeffrey Hicks, USARonald Himsel, USAGeorge Hinson, USADonald Hissong, USAJohn Hollars, USMCGeorge Jacobs, USNRichard Jefford, USNRNorris Keirn , USMCJohn Klingensmith, USNTimothy Labbe, USNNathan LaMar, USAGregory Larkin, USARobert Loviscek, Jr., USMCRobert Lusk, USAFMichael Lykens, USA, USAFDonivan Mahuron, USAF, IN ANGAndrew Martin, USAWilliam McBride, USNGerald McCarthy, USNACharles McDaniel, USANGRichard McFall, USAJames Messenger, USNBrett Monroe, USAWilliam Moore, USASCEdward Moss Sr., USNJohn Murray, USMCJames Mutter, USMCJonathon Nagel , USARJesse Newcomb, USNRAndrew Noga, USNBarry Nordblom , USCGRichard Oyler, USNTim Ping, USMCKevin Podlaski, USARichard Post, USARobert Ramey, USADonald Rector, Sr., USARonald Reimer, USNRobert Reed, USAMiles Riley, USNKristina Rivera-Rearick, USMCTravis Roll, USMCGordon Rose, USAFJack Rotzien, USAACThomas Ryan, USNDarren Salapka, USNSharon Salathe, USMCMichal Sanders, USAFGary Schmidt, USMCMark Schminke, USARJulia Scott, USAJavie Settlemore, USAChristopher Shelton, USNGWayne Shipe, USAWilliam Sills, USAFChristopher Smith, USAFJan Smith, USNKent Smith, USNGWilliam Strange, USAMik e Sturm, USNJames Sullivan, USMCMax Sullivan, USARobert Sullivan, USAFKelly Swart, USNHarry Switzer, USAFRobert Tate, USAF, USAJon Tobey, USAFJoshua Turner, USAFStephen Vicari II, USNJeffery Vidrine, USPHSKurt Von Schriltz, USARussell Warren, USANGEdward Wenrick, USAKristi Wharton, USNJames White, USA, USNGLarry White, USAFEmmett Williams, USAJohn Witt, USNMichael Wukitsch, USMCGarth Young, USCGCharles Zentz, USMC, IN NG
