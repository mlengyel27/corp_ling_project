MANCHESTER, NH -- U.S. Senator John McCain's campaign today announced its New Hampshire leadership team. In addition to activists from McCain's successful Granite State primary bids and top supporters from every major 2008 Republican primary campaign, the grassroots group includes Democrats, independents, and leaders in the education, environmental, veterans and small business communities."John McCain's New Hampshire leadership team reflects the broad spectrum of individuals who supported his candidacy and led McCain to historic victories here in 2000 and 2008," said Peter Spaulding, the Chairman of McCain's New Hampshire campaign. "These activists bring decades of invaluable New Hampshire expertise to McCain's campaign. With a strong focus on grassroots organization and spreading John McCain's message in communities across the state, this team will help John McCain win New Hampshire in November."Nancy Merrill, state McCain co-chair, added: "John McCain has traveled extensively across the Granite State, attracting strong and loyal support in all corners of New Hampshire. Working community-to-community, our statewide leadership team will continue to expand and energize an already strong McCain grassroots network. Our efforts will be guided by John McCain's powerful record of bipartisan reform and his commitment to bringing the change we need to Washington."McCain delivered remarks and answered questions at a town hall meeting in Rochester on Tuesday, his third such event in New Hampshire since March. During the 2008 primary campaign, McCain held more than 100 town hall meetings across New Hampshire.JOHN MCCAIN 2008 NEW HAMPSHIRE LEADERSHIP TEAMPeter J.
