DES MOINES, IA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the launch of the Iowa Veterans for McCain Leadership with a gathering at the state capitol to pledge their support for John McCain and to screen the campaign video entitled, "The Obama Iraq Documentary: Whatever the Politics Demand.""Whether as a soldier, a leader or a citizen, John McCain has always put his country first," said Curly Hultman, Chair of Iowa Veterans for McCain. "He has been a tireless advocate for our troops who are currently serving, as well as all the soldiers from different generations who have returned to civilian life. Unlike his opponent, John McCain doesn't need to make campaign stops overseas in an attempt to beef up his foreign policy credentials. He already has the credentials, the experience and the judgment we need. That is why veterans throughout Iowa are eager to give our support to John McCain."Chuck Larson Sr., Vice Chair of the Iowa Veterans for McCain, added, "My son and I have both spent time in the combat zone in Iraq, and I can say that in these dangerous times we cannot afford to have an inexperienced commander in chief. We need a leader with strong foreign policy and national security experience and that is Senator John McCain.Featured speakers included Iowa Veterans for McCain Chairman Major General (Ret.)
