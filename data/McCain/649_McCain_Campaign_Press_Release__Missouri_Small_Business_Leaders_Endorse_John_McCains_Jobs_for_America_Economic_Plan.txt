ST. LOUIS, MO -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced its Missouri Small Business Leaders for McCain leadership. Small business owners from the Show-Me State endorsed John McCain's economic plan, joining business leaders across the country who have praised John McCain's jobs-first plan to grow the economy as president."John McCain will reform government, achieve energy security, and ensure that health care and a quality education are affordable and available to all Americans. He understands that Missourians are hurting due to tough economic times, and has put forth a comprehensive approach to take on America's challenges head on," said Colonel Jack Jackson, chairman of John McCain's Missouri campaign. "Small businesses are the engine that keeps our economy growing, and the support of so many small business leaders is a telling sign that McCain is taking the right approach to fixing our economy."Kirk Mathews of Inpatient Management added, "Even in the face of economic challenges, small businesses create jobs. We need policies that will fuel expansion and job growth, not restrict it. John McCain's plans for making health insurance affordable and reducing taxes are good for small business. In this election, the choice is clear that John McCain is the right choice for small business and job creation."Today in Denver, CO, John McCain set the stage for the week by announcing his jobs-first economic plan in Colorado, kicking off five days of economic themed activity in critical battleground states. Later this week John McCain will be visiting Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin to highlight his plans to grow our economy, and to contrast it Barack Obama's votes to raise taxes on families making as little as $32,000 a year.SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS FOR MCCAIN CHAIRSVan Allen, Timeline RecruitingGordon Alt, Music Store ownerShawn Archambault, Archie CommunicationsJoe Balsoratti, Software To GoPaul Birner, Amazing SidingBecky Bodenstab, Priority FinancialChristie Boen, ChiropractorLinda Boyd-Shell, Boyd-Shell RealtyPatty Boyers, Boycom Cable VisionChris Carnahan, Boone Valley Forest ProductGonzalo Corvera, Corvera AbatementSteve Cusamano, Cusamano Vision CenterRuss Duker, Master Tech IncDavid Fernandez, JDCMike Gaffney, Skyline AeronauticsBill Glaser, Legacy Wealth AdvisorsAl Gonzalez, Hispanic Chamber of St. LouisCord Harper, AuthorJim Henderson, Dynamic SalesLaura Herring, Impact GroupDon Hockenbury, Garlich PrintingEd Horton, Navigation CorpCharlene Jayamanne, National MarketingMatthew Kent, Realty MD LLCVirginia Kirkpatrick, CVK PersonnelDave Kruse, Revelation ProductsKirk Mathews, Inpatient ManagementJudy Meador, Former owner, St. Louis Small Business MonthlyTom Mendenhal, REMM LtdJohn Morganthor, AerocharterCarm Natoli, Natoli EngineeringTerry Orf, Inpatient ManagementJanet Poppen, Poppen and Associates CPAs PCDanette Proctor, D-4 InvestmentsAnthony Ramirez, Anthony B.
