BELLEVUE, WA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced Washington's Grassroots Leadership Team. This team of local Washington leaders will help organize and manage the campaign's grassroots efforts, including the "get out the vote" turnout operation, in each county and city across the state of Washington.Each of Washington's 39 counties will have a designated chairman at the local level to serve as the point of contact for local volunteers and supporters, and to help communicate John McCain's message of country first, national security, stronger economy and government reform."John McCain's maverick record and ability to work across party lines to reach common ground appeals to the independence inherent in the voters of Washington," said Ralph Munro, former Washington Secretary of State. "McCain's pledge to put country above politics is not an empty sound bite from a rehearsed speech but rather a guiding principle that has shaped his entire life. From his time in the Hanoi Hilton to his successful record in Congress, John McCain has shown the leadership and character that will deliver results for Washingtonians."Ralph Munro continued, "Our leadership team brings countless years of experience in Washington. Our grassroots team will effectively carry our message of lower taxes, energy independence and a safe America to every voter in our 39 counties. John McCain will provide the leadership much needed to ensure a more successful tomorrow."WASHINGTON GRASSROOTS LEADERSHIP TEAMHonorary State ChairmanRob McKenna, Attorney GeneralHonorary Co-ChairsSlade Gordon, former United States SenatorRalph Munro, former Washington Secretary of StateDella Newman, former AmbassadorWashington County ChairsAdamsKathy BowenAsotinSusan FaganBentonTony BenegasChelanFredi SimpsonClallamJim McEntireClarkMargie FerrrisAnne DonnellyColumbiaAnn HeathCowlitzHal PalmerDennis WebberDouglasJon WyssFerryBob MoranGarfieldAnn HeathGrantD.
