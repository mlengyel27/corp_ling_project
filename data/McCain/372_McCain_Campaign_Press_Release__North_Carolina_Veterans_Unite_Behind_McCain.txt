TALLAHASSEE, FL -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced the leadership of North Carolina Veterans for John McCain, a statewide grassroots organization that will work to bolster John McCain's support within North Carolina's veterans' community."John McCain has always fought to make sure America's veterans are treated with dignity and respect," said Statewide Veterans Chair and NC State Representative Ric Killian, Lt. Col. USAR. "But above all else North Carolina veterans support John McCain because he is the candidate who has a proven track record of putting country first and making the tough and sometimes unpopular decisions to defend our country."Col. Quincy Collins added, "Americans know what they're getting with John McCain. John McCain is a battle-tested leader who proudly served his country for over two decades in the U.S. Navy. I got to know John well when we lived in the same cell for a year at the Hanoi Hilton and know that he is the only man in the race who has the judgment, experience and character to lead our country in these difficult times."Today's announcement occurs in conjunction with Veterans for McCain rallies in Raleigh, Charlotte and throughout the country.NORTH CAROLINA VETERANS FOR JOHN MCCAIN LEADERSHIP TEAMState ChairsRic Killian, USAR, NC State RepresentativeJ.
