Mitt Romney today announced the support of Washington State elected officials and leaders. These supporters join a growing list that includes Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Jaime Herrera Beutler, Secretary of State Sam Reed, former Congressman George Nethercutt and former State Senator Dino Rossi."These leaders share my goals to get government out of the lives of Washingtonians," said Mitt Romney. "In order to lower spending, repeal Obamacare, and bring back jobs, we must first defeat President Obama. With the hard work of these leaders, we can bring conservative change to the White House.""Mitt Romney has such strong support in Washington because he is the only candidate who can defeat President Obama and bring the principles we have been fighting for in Washington State to the White House," said Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. "Our state and our country cannot afford four more years of failure from President Obama. He has failed to deliver on the promises he made four years ago and it is time that we have a leader in the White House who can fix our fiscal mess and save the economy."Washington Elected Officials snd Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Member of CongressJaime Herrera Beutler, Member of CongressSam Reed, Washington Secretary of StateGeorge Nethercutt, Former Member of Congress & U.S. Senate CandidateDino Rossi, Former State Senator & Gubernatorial & U.S. Senate CandidateRalph Munro, former Washington Secretary of State Mike Hewitt, State Senate Republican LeaderAndy Hill, State SenatorDon Benton, State SenatorJoe Fain, State SenatorSteve Litzow, State SenatorBob Morton, State SenatorPam Roach, State SenatorMark Schoesler, State SenatorJoe Zarelli, State SenatorRichard DeBolt, State Representative & House Republican LeaderJT Wilcox, State RepresentativeJohn Ahern, State RepresentativeSusan Fagan, State RepresentativeCathy Dahlquist, State RepresentativeBruce Dammeier, State RepresentativePaul Harris, State RepresentativeLarry Haler, State RepresentativeBill Hinkle, State RepresentativeMike Hope, State RepresentativeKevin Parker, State RepresentativeAnn Rivers, State RepresentativeJay Rodne, State RepresentativeJudy Warnick, State RepresentativeDan McDonald, former State Senator and Majority LeaderLuke Esser, former Chair, Washington State Republican PartyJack & Sharon Silzel, SpokanePete Von Reichbauer, King County CouncilmemberKim Werdel, Executive Director, Jennifer Dunn Leadership InstituteTrina Wilbur, Party ActivistCarlos S.
