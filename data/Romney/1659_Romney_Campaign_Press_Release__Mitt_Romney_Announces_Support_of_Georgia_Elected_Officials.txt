Mitt Romney today announced the support of current and former Georgia elected officials."My growing support in Georgia is proof that my conservative message is resonating with Georgia voters," said Mitt Romney. "With the help of my team, we will defeat President Obama, repeal Obamacare, cut government spending, and bring jobs back and turn around our economy.""Mitt Romney is the one conservative candidate who will be able to defeat President Obama in November and bring real change to Washington — that is why he is supported by so many conservative Georgians," said former Attorney General Mike Bowers. "On the most pressing issue to our state and country, jobs and the economy, Mitt Romney possesses greater knowledge and experience than the other candidates combined. Georgians can be confident that if Mitt Romney is elected, they will have a president who will get Washington out of the way of job creation and personal freedom."Georgia Current and Former Elected Officials Endorsing Mitt Romney:Former Georgia Attorney General Mike BowersGeorgia Representative Tom WeldonDouglas County School Board Member Janet KelleyGeorgia Elected Officials and Leaders Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:Attorney General Sam OlensFormer House Speaker Mark BurkhalterState Senator Cecil Staton, Majority WhipState Senator Bill Hamrick, Chairman of Senate Judiciary CommitteeState Senator Fran MillarState Senator Johnny GrantState Senator Greg GoggansState Senator Jeff MullisState Representative & House Majority Whip Edward LindseyState Representative Calvin Hill, Vice Chairman of House Appropriations CommitteeState Representative Wendell Willard, Chairman of House Judiciary CommitteeState Representative Bruce WilliamsonState Representative B.J.
