Mitt Romney today announced additions to his Virginia Steering Committee."My strong support in Virginia is a sign that my pro-growth vision for the country is breaking through," said Mitt Romney. "Virginia has used conservative principles to make the state a leader in job growth and innovation. I plan to use these same principles to get our country's economy back on track and restore America's promise.""I am delighted that these Republican leaders have decided to endorse Governor Romney and join our growing team in Virginia," said Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling. "They know that Governor Romney is the best person to lead our country toward a more prosperous future with more jobs, less debt and smaller government.  Governor Romney is the only candidate who can defeat President Obama in November. I look forward to joining them in support of Mitt Romney at the March 6 Virginia primary and working with them in the months to come to promote Governor Romney's candidacy.""I welcome these great Virginians to our growing team," said Governor Bob McDonnell. "Like Mitt Romney, they are results oriented conservatives who know that lower taxes and less spending will create a positive environment for private sector job-creation. With their help, we will win this November and put Mitt Romney, an experienced leader, in the White House."Additional Members of Mitt Romney's Virginia Steering Committee:Delegate Rich Anderson, Co-ChairDelegate Joe May, Co-ChairDelegate Ron Villanueva, Co-ChairChairman Corey Stewart, Co-Chair3rd District Chair Chris Woodfin, Steering Committee3rd District State Central Committee, E.
