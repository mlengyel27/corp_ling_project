"With a Democrat legislature, I helped turn my state from deficit to surplus, from job losses to job growth and from higher taxes to higher take-home pay. That's why I am running for President. I want to help the country do those same things." â€” Mitt RomneyRemarksDes Moines, IowaNovember 4, 2012ClickHereTo Watch Mitt RomneyMITT ROMNEY:"The question of this election comes down to this: Do you want four more years like the last four years or do you want real change? President Obama promised change but he couldn't deliver it. I not only promised change, I have a record of achieving it. I built a business. I turned around another business. I helped put the Olympics back on track. And then with a Democrat legislature, I helped turn my state from deficit to surplus, from job losses to job growth and from higher taxes to higher take-home pay. That's why I am running for President. I want to help the country do those same things."
