MEMORANDUMTo:                 Interested PartiesFrom:             Matt Rhoades, Campaign ManagerRe:                 America's Comeback TeamDate:             8/17/2012Tomorrow marks a week since Mitt Romney announced his choice of Congressman Paul Ryan to join him on America's Comeback Team, and it's clear that his choice has reshaped the race in a positive way.  The Obama team's increasing vitriol is a sure sign that they're rattled by the pick.  Unable to engage in an elevated policy debate, they've spent the past few days drowning in their own venom.Since the announcement in Norfolk, Virginia on Saturday:Online FundraisingDonations: 124,800+Amount: $10,157,947Average Donation: $81% New Donors: 68%Site TrafficTotal: 2,000,000Desktop: 1,560,000Mobile: 440,000Mitt Romney SocialFacebook: +510,000 -- Now 4,360,000Twitter: +54,000 -- Now 861,000Paul Ryan SocialFacebook: +860,000Twitter: +118,500Volunteers45,000+ sign up to volunteer onlinePresident Obama is on defense over his $716 billion raid of current Medicare beneficiaries to pay for Obamacare, and allowing the hospital trust fund to go broke by the time those aged 50 or below are Medicare eligible.  The political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee warned this week that the issue could cost Democrats the election.At the same time, the Romney Plan for a Stronger Middle Class is gaining traction.  Voters in the swing states believe that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a better plan than Barack Obama and Joe Biden "to reduce the deficit, create jobs and get the economy moving."[1]Polling data shows Romney gaining since the announcement.  Both Gallup and Rasmussen show us leading Obama in national polling, and recent statewide polling shows us picking up ground in Ohio and Virginia.While President Obama's team continues its campaign of frustration and division to distract voters from his failed record, the Romney-Ryan team will continue offering solutions to the challenges facing our nation.  America is ready for a comeback and if this past week is any indication, America's comeback will begin on November 6th.[1]Data from "Purple Poll" conducted August 13-14, 2012.
