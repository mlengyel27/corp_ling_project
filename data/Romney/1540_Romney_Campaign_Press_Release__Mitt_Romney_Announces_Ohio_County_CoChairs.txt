Mitt Romney today announced his Ohio County Co-Chairs. Romney for President has Co-Chairs in all 88 counties."My increasing support in Ohio is a sign that voters are looking for a Washington outsider with a bold vision for our economy," said Mitt Romney. "In order to defeat President Obama in November, I will need the hard work of my county co-chairs. Ohio can't afford four more years of President Obama's failed policies.""Ohioans are looking for a Washington outsider to lead our country, not a Washington insider who has been part of the problem," said former Columbus Mayor Greg Lashutka. "Mitt Romney's bold plan to turn around our economy and bring relief to the middle class is further proof that his team is the American people. With Mitt Romney as president, Ohioans can be confident that there will be more jobs, less debt and smaller government."Mitt Romney's Ohio County Co-Chairs:Adams — Earl GillAllen — Reverand Jerry and Anita VanTilburgAshland — Bonnie ManorsAshtabula — Myra BrownAthens — Anne CartoAuglaize — Wanda KoggeAuglaize — Wes FarnoBelmont — Chris WalisiakBrown — Dorothy WallsButler — Terri StuderCarroll — David JonesChampaign — Tanner LawrenceClark — GOP County Chair Lynda SmithClermont — Clifford Allen StillClinton — Mayor Randy RileyColumbiana — David JohnsonColumbiana — Gary WhitlaCoshocton — Cathy BurnsCrawford — Carol CampbellCuyahoga — Gregory DeSenaCuyahoga — Jeffrey DeanCuyahoga — Lucy StickanCuyahoga — Young Republicans National Chairwoman Lisa StickanDarke — John K.
