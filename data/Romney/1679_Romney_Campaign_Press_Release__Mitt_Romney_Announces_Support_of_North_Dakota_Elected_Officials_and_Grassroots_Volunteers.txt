Mitt Romney today announced the support of North Dakota statewide elected officials. He also announced his grassroots volunteer team."It is an honor to have such an overwhelming number of supporters on our team in North Dakota, and I want to thank Senator John Hoeven and his wife Mikey Hoeven for serving as honorary co-chairs of our growing team," said Mitt Romney. "These leaders understand that President Obama's policies are not helping North Dakota. With their hard work, we can make sure that Washington gets out of the way of states like North Dakota so they can develop their energy resources and create an environment for businesses to expand and hire."Announcing the additions to Mitt Romney's North Dakota team, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said, "Mitt Romney enjoys widespread support across North Dakota because he is the best candidate to defeat President Obama, put an end to the out of control spending in Washington, and lead an economic turnaround. No other candidate, either in the White House or in the Republican Party, has the lifelong record of successful leadership that Mitt Romney has. At no time in recent history has our country needed a strong leader like Mitt Romney as we do now. That is why I support Mitt Romney and why I urge fellow North Dakotans to support him as well."North Dakota Statewide Officials Endorsing Mitt Romney:Attorney General Wayne StenehjemInsurance Commissioner Adam HammState Auditor Bob PetersonAgriculture Commissioner Doug GoehringNorth Dakota State Senators Endorsing Mitt Romney:Senator Dwight CookSenator Layton FreborgSenator David HogueSenator Ray HolmbergSenator Lonnie LaffenSenator Stan LysonSenator Dave NethingSenator George NodlandSenator Dave OehlkeSenator Ron SorvaagSenator Judy LeeNorth Dakota House Members Endorsing Mitt Romney:Representative Tom BeadleRepresentative Don ClarkRepresentative Stacey DahlRepresentative Bob FrantsvogRepresentative Kathy HawkenRepresentative Curt HofstadRepresentative Dennis JohnsonRepresentative Nancy JohnsonRepresentative Larry KleminRepresentative Andy MaragosRepresentative Mike NatheRepresentative Jon NelsonRepresentative Mark OwensRepresentative Mark SanfordGrassroots Supporters:Fargo AreaPam YounggrenLinn WebbRob LindbergSandy BoehlerMargaret MoweryVicki FredricksonBruce FurnessGrand Forks Devils Lake AreaNate MartindaleDan TraynorSusan ShearerBeth BouleyMae Marie BlackmoreBen and Bev ClayburghVonda MarkestadBismarck/Minot/Dickinson AreaLinda and Alan ButtsBob HarmsDiane LillisYvonne and Gene KrollClare and Lisa CarlsonJody ReinkeJim and Nicole PoolmanShari Haugen HoffartBill and Bonnie DanielKaren KalkFran GronbergMarlene Sax
