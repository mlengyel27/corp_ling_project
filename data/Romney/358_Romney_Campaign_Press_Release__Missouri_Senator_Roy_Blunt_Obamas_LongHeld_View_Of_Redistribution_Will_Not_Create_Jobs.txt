"Mr. President, the number one job of this Congress domestically should have been more private sector jobs. The President's long-held view of redistribution as a goal for the government is not going to accomplish that." — Missouri Senator Roy BluntFloor SpeechU.S. SenateWashington, D.C.September 20, 2012MISSOURI SENATOR ROY BLUNT:"Mr. President, the number one job of this Congress domestically should have been more private sector jobs. The President's long-held view of redistribution as a goal for the government is not going to accomplish that. What's going to accomplish that is more opportunity, more independence, as my friend from Arkansas just said, more certainty, more American energy. These problems are big, Mr. President, but they're not necessarily that complicated. We just have to have the willpower to deal with them."
