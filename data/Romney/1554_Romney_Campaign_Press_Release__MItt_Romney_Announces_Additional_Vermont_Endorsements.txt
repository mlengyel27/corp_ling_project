Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Vermont."My growing support in Vermont is a sign that my pro-growth message is resonating in the state," said Mitt Romney. "Voters in Vermont and across the country are tired of the broken promises from Washington. I spent my life outside Washington, working in the private sector, and know what it will take to turn around our economy. I look forward to working with these fine leaders from Vermont to defeat President Obama and bring change to the broken Washington system.""Vermont voters are looking for someone to go to Washington, turn around our economy and fix the fiscal mess that Washington politicians have created," said former Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. "Mitt Romney is the one candidate with the track record and economic plan to do just that. With Mitt Romney as president, Vermont voters can be confident that we will have more jobs, smaller government and less debt."Vermont Elected Officials and Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:Former Lieutenant Governor Brian DubieState Senator Joe BenningState Senator Richard WestmanFormer Speaker of the House Walter FreedNational Committeeman George SchiavoneNational Committeewoman Susie HudsonFormer Vermont Republican Party Chairwoman Pat McDonaldVermont Elected Officials and Leaders Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:State Auditor Tom SalmonSenate Minority Leader William DoyleState Senator Randy BrockState Senator Peg FloryState Senator Vince IlluzziState Senator Kevin MullinState Representative and Former Vermont Republican Party Chairman Joe AcinapuraState Representative Gregory ClarkState Representative Howard CrawfordState Representative Dustin DegreeState Representative Eileen DickinsonState Representative Peter FaganState Representative Mike HebertState Representative Robert HelmState Representative Robert LewisState Representative Linda MyersState Representative Gerald ReisState Representative Vicki StrongWendy Wilton; Former State Senator and Rutland City TreasurerSteve Larabee; Former State Representative and former Vermont Republican Party ChairmanThomas Lauzon; Barre MayorChris Roy; Former Republican Candidate for Secretary of StateTim Haywood; Chief of Staff to former Governor Jim DouglasJim Barnett; Former Vermont Republican Party ChairmanJack Lindley; Vermont Republican Party ChairmanAllen Martin; Former Vermont Republican Party ChairmanBradford Broyles; Rutland County Republican ChairKen Copp; Essex County Republican ChairDr. Bill Minsinger; Orange County Republican ChairDan Riley; Bennington County Republican ChairHugh Tallman; Lamoille County Republican ChairLeo Valliere; Washington County Republican Chair and former State RepresentativeChuck Wilton; Rutland County Republican Finance ChairLenny Barclay; Londonderry Town Republican ChairDon Bostic; Saint Johnsbury Town GOP Chair and former State RepresentativeDel Cook; Brandon Town Republican ChairLawrence Daley; Peru Town Republican ChairJoe DeFreitas; Bethel Town Republican ChairDawn Hill-Fleury; Essex Town Republican ChairCliff King; East Montpelier Town Republican ChairBruce Lonergan; Bennington Town Republican ChairEric Osgood; Johnson Town Republican ChairMike Lannon; Rutland City Republican ChairDon Trachte; Sandgate Town GOP ChairPatricia Morale; Secretary of the Pittsford Town Republican PartyJohn Kleinhans; Former Vermont College Republican PresidentMarilyn Childs; State Central CommitteeRon Meroli; State Central CommitteeBob and Pat Nowak; State Central CommitteeAnn Valliere; State Central CommitteeJohn and Carol Wu; State Central CommitteeLynn Lindley; Montpelier City CommitteeJ.
