Romney for President today announced its Wisconsin Women for Mitt coalition."I am running to ensure that our future generations aren't saddled with trillions of dollars in debt, can find a good job, and comfortably raise their families," said Mitt Romney. "These women realize that we need new leadership in Washington if we are going to restore America's promise and keep our future bright."Wisconsin Women for Mitt Chair State Senator Alberta Darling said, "Women in Wisconsin support Mitt Romney because he has a bold plan to fix our economy and get government out of our lives. President Obama came to Wisconsin four years ago and promised to fix Washington but in one term he has only made things worse. We need a conservative outsider like Mitt Romney to shake up Washington and make sure that future generations are not burdened by the failed policies of the current administration."Wisconsin Women for MittBrown County — Jess GavicChippewa County — Charlotte RasmussenDane County — Kimberly ZakDane County — Margaret MorrisonDane County — Marilyn StauterDane County — Maria MoellerDane County — Rachel LakeDane County — Lynda PattersonDane County — Mary BaldwinDane County — Tracy SchwartzDodge County — Lucinda WagnerDodge County — Tammy GiesickDodge County Muriel Jane HarperDouglas County — Donna PavlovichDunn County — Sharon WilkinsFlorence County — Barbara DagostinoGreen County — Marilyn JegerlehnerJefferson County — Betsey DeloreyJuneau County — Carrie DutscheckKewaunee County — Natalie HollidayLa Crosse County — Lauren Ann RehrauerLafayette County — Pearl SoperLincoln County — Patricia HellerManitowoc County — Maria ForsterMarathon County — Marlene KrenzMarinette County — Arleen MessengerMarquette County — Roberta BrownMilwaukee County — Michell PrescottMilwaukee County — Julie KossMilwaukee County — Laila MatinianMilwaukee County — Pamela CannonMilwaukee County — Shirley SteeleMilwaukee County — Marian ManyoMilwaukee County — Michelle Lund BaronMilwaukee County — Carolyn VisteMilwaukee County — Ann AtkielskiMilwaukee County — Mary ArmataMilwaukee County — Felicia RadkeMilwaukee County — Constance HaasMilwaukee County — Carol ScudderMilwaukee County — Elsie ThompsonMilwaukee County — Audrey HansenMilwaukee County — Jessica MaluegMilwaukee County — Gail KolosovskyMilwaukee County — Barbara AxlineMonroe County — Grace KonishOneida County — Margaret MoyerOutagamie County — Doris HeissPepin County — Irene SchuhPolk County — Joyce AndersonPortage County — Virginia WentzelRichland County — Merna QueenSt. Croix County — Shirley StrobushTrempealeau County — Julie HallamVilas County — Joyce MitchellWalworth County — Bonnie AllegrettiWalworth County — Angela ShafferWashington County — Britney FitzpatrickWaukesha County — Cindy SeidleWaukesha County — Carrie VisseringWaukesha County — Ann DanielWaukesha County — Teresa SmithWaukesha County — Sandy HarshWaukesha County — Mary KrajnakWaukesha County — Mary Jo BaasWaukesha County — Arlene HaasWaukesha County — Barbara KelloggWaushara County — Patricia MillerWinnebago County — Lauree FrechetteWinnebago County — Jenna KienbaumWinnebago County — Dianne Komenaka
