Mitt Romney today announced his Idaho County Chairs."I am pleased to announce the addition of these hard-working community leaders to my campaign in Idaho," said Mitt Romney. "My growing grassroots support is a sign that my message of cutting government spending and freeing the American entrepreneurial spirit is resonating with Idaho voters.""I want to welcome these Idahoans to the ever growing Romney team," said U.S. Senator Jim Risch. "The work of our volunteer team will be critical to defeating President Obama, repealing Obamacare and getting spending under control in Washington. We still have much more work to do, but our team in Idaho is committed to working as hard as we can to spread Mitt Romney's conservative pro-growth message across Idaho and help him get elected in November."Ada CountyDave and Jacqui ShurtleffGayann DemourdantPam PratherMike and Debbie FieldDustin KuckBrenda Maynard WaltersJeff JohnsonCameron and Jaime ArialBen BarrusKent GoldthorpeGreg and Mary Jo OgdenWayne HammonTyler HurstAdams CountyBill BrownBannock CountyDoug SayerVerna WalkerKen WebsterSteve BrownJeremy FieldJosh TolmanCraig ParrishEvan FrasierBear Lake CountyJohn and Nancy TippetsBenewah CountyTim and Carey GrubhamBingham CountyWayne KendallJosh and Amy SorensonMark ConeliesonScott ReeseDan CravensZack AdamsJosh and Amy ThompsonGinette ManwaringBlaine CountyDebbie O'NeillDavid GardnerBoise CountyRay RankinBonner CountyBritt IveyBonneville CountyDane WatkinsRebecca CasperBrad ChristensenBoundary CountyDennis SwensonTim WilsonButte CountyJanet AikeleCamas CountyTyler BallardCanyon CountyTodd LakeyCindy LunaTracey WasdenTodd and Pam BurnsCaribou CountyTrent ClarkCassia CountyHeidi CranneyNick RobisonDoug PickettClark CountyRichard LarsenBrian EgganClearwater CountyHeather LeachCuster CountyMarty OrwigElmore CountyCarleen LordBarry PetersonFranklin CountyNate OlsenFremont CountyStan ClarkGem CountyTrent BeattieGooding CountyRobert FitzgeraldIdaho CountyEileen UhlenkottJefferson CountyCameron and Bev WheelerJoAn WoodJohn and Colleen EricksonJerome CountyDel KohtzKootenaiRon NilsonDonna MontgomeryFreeman DuncanSid SmithRonda NashLatah CountyEarl BennettDan MaderRyan SargentLemhi CountyJim Bob InfangerLewis CountyEd HolmesLincoln CountyVictor SchoesslerMadison CountyRonald and Maria NateMatt GarnerDr Hans ReddVerla MossElaine KingJericho ClineMinidoka CountyElaine StephensonJeremy AndersonNez Perce CountyBrian and Sherri RothfuszOneida CountyElaine BohnOwyhee CountyFrances FieldPayette CountyScott and Carmen MoscripPower CountyMoon and Ann WheelerDelane and Laura AndersonKathryn NelsonShoshone CountyLee HaynesTeton CountyParis and Janet PenfoldTwin Falls CountyRick PearsonBrent and Linda CulverTom BillingtonMike MathewsLance ClowChenele DixonSteve MillingtonDorienne KnightBrian JohnsValley CountyJean VanceTyler VanceWashington CountyTaylor Mink
