Mitt Romney today announced the support of business leaders in South Carolina."These business leaders in South Carolina are an important part of our country's economic engine," said Mitt Romney. "But they can't afford four more years of an over-taxing, over-spending, over-regulating Obama Administration. As President, I will put in place policies that free the private sector to do what it does best: create jobs. With the help of leaders like these, we will get our economy back on the right track.""Mitt Romney will be able to fix our economy and create jobs - because he has had one," said Barry Wynn. "When Mitt Romney becomes president, job creators across the country will be able to have the confidence that their president is supporting them, not trying to demonize them and regulate them out of business. Along with these other South Carolina business leaders, I am proud to endorse Mitt Romney because we know he will reinvigorate South Carolina's economy and the American entrepreneurial spirit."South Carolina business leaders supporting Mitt Romney:William Biggs, AndersonDr. William Bogache, Grand Strand Urology, Myrtle BeachWilliam Bradshaw, Bradshaw Automotive, GreerTerry S.
