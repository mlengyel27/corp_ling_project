Mitt Romney today announced the support of Minnesota leaders."I'm quite proud to have the support of these Minnesota conservative leaders," said Mitt Romney. "This wide-ranging support shows that my message of a smaller, simpler, and smarter federal government is resonating with Minnesotans as it is with voters across the country. I'm counting on these leaders to help me spread this message in the months to come."Announcing his support, Speaker Kurt Zellers said, "Minnesotans simply cannot take four more years of President Obama's disastrous policies. Mitt Romney is the conservative candidate who has a clear plan to empower small businesses, rebuild the middle class, and create long-lasting economic growth. I am endorsing Mitt because he will work to improve the economy, reduce burdensome regulations and reverse economic policies that expand government rather than private sector job growth."Minnesota Elected Officials and Leaders Supporting Mitt Romney:Speaker of the House Kurt ZellersHouse Majority Leader Matt DeanSenator Roger ChamberlainRepresentative Kurt DaudtRepresentative Dan FabianRepresentative Joe HoppeRepresentative Jennifer LoonRepresentative Linda RunbeckRepresentative Tim SandersFormer Executive Director, Minnesota College Republicans Tara AndersonFormer Mayor of New Brighton and former 4th district GOP Chair Bev AplikowskiFormer National Committeewoman Evie AxdahlRepublican Activist Dirk BakFormer Republican Candidate for Minnesota Attorney General Chris BardenRepublican Activist Andy BrehmRepublican Activist Ward BrehmFormer State Representative Laura BrodRepublican Activist Mike CampbellFormer Chairman, Republican Party of Minnesota Ron EibensteinerRepublican Activist John FrydenlundRepublican Activist Matthew GallRepublican Activist Betsy GallFormer Chairman, Minnesota College Republicans Jake GrasselMinnesota Republican Party 4th Congressional District Officer Mary IgoFormer Minnesota Republican Party 4th Congressional District Chair Pat IgoSmall Business Owner Gary IoccoFormer Minnesota Republican Party Vice-Chairwoman Chris JacobsonRepublican Activist Greg JohnsonMinnesota Republican Party BPOU Chair Pat KaluzaRepublican Activist Matt KirkpatrickRepublican Activist Carrie KirkpatrickFormer State Representative Paul KohlsRepublican Activist Lisa Laliberte BelakVice President of Trade Marketing, General Mills Lohr LeSueurMinnesota Republican Party 8th Congressional District Chair Ted LovdahlMayor of Brooklyn Park Jeff LundeRepublican Activist Lynn McHaleFormer National Committeeman & Chairman of Romney for President Steering Committee Jack MeeksFormer Executive Director, Minnesota Republican Party Corey MiltimoreRepublican Activist William OpsahlRepublican Activist Andy PostRepublican Activist Jeff QuinnellChairman of the BPOU Chairs Joe SalmonFormer Treasurer, College Republican National Committee and 7th Congressional District Vice Chair Chris TiedemanFormer Minnesota Republican Party Chairman Bob WeinholzerFormer BPOU Chair Janet WeirFormer BPOU Chair Gerald Woodley
