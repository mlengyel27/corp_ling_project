Mitt Romney today announced additional Colorado current and former elected leaders supporting his campaign."The endorsements by these leaders from all across Colorado are a sign that my message of smaller government is resonating with Coloradans," said Mitt Romney. "Colorado will be an important state in our efforts to bring conservative change to Washington. I look forward to working with these leaders in that effort."Announcing his support, State Representative Kevin Priola said, "So many leaders in Colorado support Mitt Romney because he is the only candidate who will be able to fix the mess in Washington. President Obama came to Colorado four years ago and made promises to Coloradans that he has not kept. Instead of fixing our economy, President Obama has only grown government and made job creation more difficult. Mitt Romney spent most of his life in the private sector and knows how jobs are created because he has had one. He will use the lessons he learned in the private sector to grow our economy and bring jobs to Colorado. That is why I support Mitt Romney and urge Coloradans to support him Tuesday â€” our country deserves a leader like him."Colorado Elected Officials And Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:Erik Hansen, Adams County CommissionerMatt Heimerich, former Crowley County CommissionerJohn Odom, Jefferson County CommissionerWayne Williams, El Paso County ClerkJean White, State SenatorTom Massey, State RepresentativeSpencer Swalm, State RepresentativeMark Waller, State RepresentativeCheri Gerou, State RepresentativeLarry Liston, State RepresentativeKevin Priola, State RepresentativeJim Kerr, State RepresentativeCarole Murray, State RepresentativeRob Witwer, former State RepresentativeDan May, 4th Judicial District AttorneyBen Nighthorse Campbell, former US SenatorFrances Owens, former First Lady of ColoradoMarti Allbright Whitmore, former Chief Deputy Attorney General of ColoradoColorado Elected Officials and Leaders Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:Senator Hank BrownGovernor Bill OwensSenator Wayne AllardAttorney General John SuthersCongressman Bob BeauprezClaudia BeauprezColorado Treasurer Walker StapletonUniversity Of Colorado Regent-At-Large Steve BosleyColorado Speaker of the House Frank McNultyScott Gessler, Colorado Secretary of StateKyle Hybl, CU Regent, 5th Congressional DistrictNancy Spence, State SenatorB.J.
