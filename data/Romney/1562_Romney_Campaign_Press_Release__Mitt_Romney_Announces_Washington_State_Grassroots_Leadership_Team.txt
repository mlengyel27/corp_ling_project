Mitt Romney today announced his Washington Grassroots Leadership Team."Washington State has felt the effects of President Obama's failed economic policies," said Mitt Romney. "It is imperative that we put in place policies that will reverse the failures of the last three years. I recently laid out my vision for creating jobs and shrinking government — with the help of this team and the support of Washingtonians we will be able to bring lasting, conservative change to Washington.""Mitt Romney has laid out an economic plan that is being supported by conservatives in Washington because it is bold, comprehensive and will put Washingtonians back to work," said Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. "The strong team that the campaign has put together in Washington is a sign that Mitt Romney is the candidate that conservatives are looking to in order to defeat President Obama and put in place policies that will allow job-creators, innovators, and entrepreneurs to thrive."STATE & REGIONAL CHAIRS:Washington State Chair Congresswoman Cathy McMorris RodgersWashington State Co-Chair former US Attorney Mike McKayWashington State Co-Chair former State Senator Dino RossiCo-Vice Chair: Eastern Washington Mary DyeCo-Vice Chair: Eastern Washington former State Rep Dale ForemanCo-Vice Chair: Western Washington Rob McCallumCo-Vice Chair: Western Washington Diane TebeliusHonorary Chair former Governor & US Senator Dan EvansGrassroots coordinator Jeff McMorrisCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT CHAIRS:1st CD Chair Natalie Lavering1st CD Steering Committee Chair Dullain Ehrlich2nd CD Chair Mary Jane Olson3rd CD co-Chair Senator Don Benton3rd CD co-Chair Representative Paul Harris4th CD co-Chair Dr. Rob Merrill4th CD co-Chair David Hedengren5th CD co-Chair Frankie DeWitt5th CD co-Chair Bill Hyslop7th CD Chair David Nelson8th CD co-Chair Bob Brunjes8th CD co-Chair Representative Jay Rodne9th CD Chair Tricia Richards9th CD -- honorary Chair Bellevue Mayor Conrad Lee10th CD Chair Alex Hays10th CD -- honorary Chair Representative JT WilcoxCOUNTY CHAIRS:Clark County co-Chair Stephanie McClintockClark County co-Chair Justin RileyClark County co-Chair Greg KimseyCowlitz County Chair Heidi ShawFranklin County Chair Stephanie SwanbergGarfield County Chair Roger & Mary DyeGrant County Chair Dr. David EarlKing County Chair — northern Randy EastwoodKittitas County Chair State Representative Bill HinklePend Oreille County Chair Wayne AntcliffPierce County -- East Side County, Matt HamiltonPierce County -- West Side County, Don Anderson, Lakewood Deputy MayorSkagit County Chair - 1st CD, April AxthemSnohomish County Chair Bob WilliamsSpokane County Chair Beva MilesWahkiakum County Chair Ross KolditzWalla Walla County Chair Lisa WagnerWhatcom County Chair Darin HolmanYakima County Chair Jon DeVaneyYakima County Chair -- lower valley LaDon LindeLEGISLATIVE DISTRICT CHAIRS:1st LD co-Chair Diana Davis1st LD co-Chair Eva Davies2nd LD (east Pierce County) Matt Hamilton4th LD Diana Wilhite6th LD Dwight Calkins7th LD, rural areas, Ben Carpenter7th LD, urban areas, Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich9th LD Jeff Olson10th LD Meledie Knopf21st LD Alan Tagle25th LD co-chair Rose Hill25th LD co-chair former State Representative Dave Morrell30th LD Maureen Bernardy31st LD Dave Enslow32nd LD Paul Hess36th LD Nicole Franklin38th LD Kurt Hanke39th LD co-Chair Kenton Gidewall39th LD co-Chair Diane McAllister41st LD co-Chair Michelle Hilhorst41st LD co-Chair Mark Griswold44th LD Reggie Wight45th LD co-chair Toby Nixon45th LD co-chair Trina Wilbur46th LD Warren Peterson48th LD co-chair Bruce Hand48th LD co-chair Dave ElliottCITY CHAIRS:Arlington, Dawn DicksonBothell co-chair, Karen KingBothell co-chair Kevin GleedDuvall/Carnation, Rob MillardEverett co-Chair, Heather HainlineEverett co-Chair, Aaron WrightGranite Falls, Rene McKerveyKenmore, Randy EastwoodKirkland, Claudia BennettLake Stevens co-Chair, Alex GlavesLake Stevens co-Chair, Kerry GoodwinLynden City, Dirk BybeeMarysville co-Chair, Karen ClaytonMarysville co-Chair, Brent WardRedmond, David CarsonSnohomish (city) co-Chair, Jen StallingsSnohomish (city) co-Chair, Alicia KersavageTacoma, Beth (Jensen) & Jim ChewWoodinville co-chair, Karen ClaytonWoodinville co-chair, Brent Ward
