Mitt Romney today announced his Georgia Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will be led by Romney for President Georgia State Chairman Attorney General Sam Olens."Georgia voters are tired of the failed promises from President Obama," said Mitt Romney. "They are looking for a leader who will create jobs and stop the growth of government. With the help of these Georgia leaders, I will be able to defeat President Obama and put in place common-sense conservative principles to turn around our economy and shrink government.""Mitt Romney's plan for more jobs, less debt and smaller government is one of the many reasons that Georgia conservatives are getting behind his campaign," said Attorney General Sam Olens. "The Steering Committee has been hard at work spreading Mitt Romney's pro-growth message and will continue the hard work of defeating President Obama in November."State ChairmenGeorgia Steering Committee Chairman Attorney General Sam OlensGeorgia Grassroots Chairman Ric MayfieldState Co-ChairsSpeaker Emeritus Mark BurkhalterPublic Service Commissioner Doug EverettCommissioner of Labor Mark ButlerHouse Majority Whip Ed LindseySenate Majority Whip Cecil StatonState Senator  Bill Hamrick, Chairman of the Judiciary CommitteeState Senator Jeff Mullis, Chairman of the Transportation CommitteeState Senator Fran Millar, Chairman of the Education and Youth CommitteeState Senator  Johnny Grant, Chairman of the Public Safety CommitteeState Senator Greg Goggans, Chairman of the Insurance and Labor CommitteeState Representative  Wendell Willard, Chairman of the Judiciary CommitteeState Representative  Jay Neal, Chairman of the State Institutions and Property CommitteeState Representative  Alex Atwood, BrunswickState Representative  David Casas, LilburnState Representative  Val Clark, LawrencevilleState Representative Ben Harbin, EvansState Representative Calvin Hill, CantonState Representative Mike Jacobs, AtlantaState Representative BJ Pak LilburnState Representative Allen Peake MaconState Representative Lynne Riley, Johns CreekState Representative Jan Tankersley, BrookletState Representative Tom Taylor, DunwoodyState Representative Tom Weldon, RinggoldState Representative Bruce Williamson, MonroeSmall Businessman Joe McCutchen, EllijayLocal Officials for MittMayor of Smyrna Max BaconMayor of Johns Creek Michael BodkerMayor of Sandy Springs Eva GalambosMayor of Jasper Johnny WeaverWalton County Sheriff Joe ChapmanFulton County Commissioner Liz HausmannGwinnett County Commissioner Mike BeaudreauChatham County Commissioner Helen StoneRoswell City Councilmember Dr. Betty PriceSandy Springs City Councilman Gabe SterlingCity of Monroe Chief of Police Keith GlassCongressional District Chairmen1st Congressional District Chair Jerry Loupee2nd Congressional District Chair Tom Morrill3rd Congressional District Chair Rob Doll4th Congressional District Chair Cory Ruth5th Congressional District Chair David Burge6th Congressional District Chair Ray Smith7th Congressional District Chair Mike Beaudreau8th Congressional District Chair Myron Faircloth9th Congressional District Chair Ryan Boland10th Congressional District Chair Scott McAfee11th Congressional District Chair Justin Tomczak12th Congressional District Chair Meg Seda13th Congressional District Chair Bryan Tolar14th Congressional District Chair Jerry ShearinCounty Grassroots ChairmenBaldwin County Chair Patrick KelleyBerrien County Chair Aleta LargerBerrien County Co-Chair Theodore HerreraBibb County Chair Jason DowneyBleckley County Chair John LynchBryan  County Chair   Lynda  MorseCamden County Chair James GaineyChatham County Chair Jerry LoupeeCherokee County Chair Lori PestaClarke County Chair Scott McAfeeCobb County Co-Chair Craig StarttCobb County Co-Chair Jaime AguileraCobb County Co-Chair Justin TomczakColquitt County Chair Marion HayColumbia County Chair Cameron MasonCoweta County Chair Tim AntrimCrawford County Chair Roger GreenDawson County Chair Eric PenningtonDecatur County Chair Ryan ClevelandDeKalb County Chair Robert DallasDeKalb County Co-Chair Thomas WalkerDouglas County Chair Bryan TolarFloyd County Chair Genevieve FrazierForsyth County Chair Ryan HowellsForsyth County Co-Chair William StillFulton County Chair Alex KaufmanFulton  County Co-Chair Svein RomstadGilmer County Chair Andrew DunganGlynn  County Chair Bobby McMillinGordon County Chair Chris MockettGwinnett County Chair Bill TaylerGwinnett County Co-Chair Jose PerezHabersham County Chair Jeanette FortenberryHall County Chair Chad PooleHaralson County Chair Miles  MobleyHart County Chair Don BurdickHenry County Chair Jon HintonHouston County Chair Jason StarkeyHouston County Co-Chair Justin KnightJackson County Chair Jeremiah BancroftJasper County Chair   Larry ToneyJones  County Chair   Rusty   BolandLaurens County Chair Bob WalkerLaurens County Co-Chair Al TippettLowndes County Chair Myron FairclothLumpkin County Chair Chris BeardenMuscgoee County Chair Rob DollOconee County Chair Jason CampbellPaulding County Chair Jerry ShearinPeach  County Chair   Mark RhodenPike County Chair Beth Anne CampRichmond County Chair Robert LeiterRockdale County Chair Rick RamseyStewart County Chair Rossie RossTift County Chair Jim GoldenToombs County Chair Jim CollinsTowns County Chair Michael BarrettUnion County Chair Carl FleischerWalton County Chair   Berry GibsonWheeler County Chair Jessica Smith SchwindWhite County Chair Tracy PottsWhitfield County Chair Linda  Fowler
