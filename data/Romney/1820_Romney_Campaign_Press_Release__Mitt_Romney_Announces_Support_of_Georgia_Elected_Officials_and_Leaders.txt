Mitt Romney today announced the support of elected officials and leaders from Georgia."I'm proud to earn the support of so many great conservatives in Georgia," said Mitt Romney. "They recognize, like most Americans, that our economy is struggling today because of President Obama's failed policies. I look forward to working with them to bring my message of job creation and reduced spending to all Georgians."Announcing his support, Labor Commissioner Mark Butler said, "Mitt Romney has the temperament, experience, and leadership we need to move our country forward. I am confident he will put policies in place that will foster job growth and encourage businesses to hire because he spent his life in the private sector and understands how the real economy works. I am proud to support his campaign for president."Georgia Elected Officials Endorsing Mitt Romney:Labor Commissioner Mark ButlerState Senator Cecil Stanton, Majority WhipState Senator Johnny GrantState Senator Greg GogginsState Senator Jeff MullisState Representative Jan TankersleyState Representative Mike JacobsState Representative Ben HarbinState Representative Allen PeakeState Representative Jay NealState Representative Tom TaylorState Representative Alex AtwoodSandy Springs Mayor Eva GalambosJohns Creek Mayor Michael BodkerFulton County Commissioner Liz HausmannChatham County Commissioner Helen StoneGwinnett Commissioner Mike BeaudreauWalton County Sheriff Joe ChapmanCity of Monroe Chief of Police Keith GlassGeorgia Elected Officials Already Endorsing Mitt Romney:Attorney General Sam OlensFormer House Speaker Mark BurkhalterState Senator Bill Hamrick, Chairman of Senate Judiciary CommitteeState Senator Fran MillarState Representative Calvin Hill, Vice Chairman of House Appropriations CommitteeState Representative & House Majority Whip Edward LindseyState Representative Wendell Willard, Chairman of House Judiciary CommitteeState Representative Bruce WilliamsonState Representative B.J.
