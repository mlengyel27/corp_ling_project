"[W]e don't need sugar high economics. We don't need synthetic money creation. We need economic growth. We want wealth creation. We don't want to print money. We want opportunity and growth." — Paul RyanRemarksOldsmar, FLSeptember 15, 2012ClickHereTo Watch Paul RyanPAUL RYAN:"Now here we are, just last month we got a really bad jobs report that came to us on Friday—a week ago Friday.

We don't want to print money. We want opportunity and growth."
