Mitt Romney today announced the support of over forty business leaders from Colorado."These leaders from the Colorado business community understand how the policies of the Obama Administration have made it harder to grow and hire," said Mitt Romney. "By over-regulating and expanding the government at the expense of the private sector, President Obama has stifled the entrepreneurial spirit of job creators in Colorado and across the country. I will work with these business leaders to lessen the regulatory burden and shrink government so that the private sector can thrive and create jobs.""Job creators in Colorado and across the country support Mitt Romney because he knows that the only way Washington can help create jobs is by getting out of the way of innovation and entrepreneurship," said Liberty Media Corporation CEO Greg Maffei. "No other candidate, in the Republican field and certainly not in the White House, has his understanding of how the economy works and how jobs are created. With Mitt Romney in the White House, job creators can be confident that they will have a president who will encourage private sector job growth and who will make sure that Washington does not stand in the way of the American entrepreneurial spirit."Business Leaders from Colorado Supporting Mitt Romney:Greg Maffei, CEO, Liberty Media CorporationPhilip F.
