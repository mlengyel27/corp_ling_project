Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Alabama."My support is growing in Alabama because voters in the state are looking for a change of direction in Washington," said Mitt Romney. "President Obama has grown government at the expense of the private sector. I will shrink government and expand the private sector with the help of these leaders."Announcing his support, State Representative Blaine Galliher said, "Mitt Romney's plan for more jobs, smaller government, and less debt is exactly what conservatives are looking for in Alabama. After three years of exploding debt and fewer jobs, it is clear that we need a proven job creator and budget cutter like Mitt Romney in the White House. We are supporting Mitt Romney because our country can't afford four more years of President Obama and because Alabama deserves a proven leader like Mitt Romney as president."Alabama Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:House Majority Leader Micky HammonState Representative Blaine Galliher, Chairman of the House Rules CommitteeState Representative David SessionsState Representative Mike HillState Representative Richard BaughnState Representative Harry ShiverState Representative Mike MillicanState Representative Mike BallRandy McKinney, AL State Board of Education, District 1George Williams, Alabama Republican Party Senior Vice ChairmanDarius Foster, Chairman of the Alabama Minority GOPGreg AlbrittonPrevious Alabama Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:Former Governor Bob RileySpeaker of the House Mike HubbardLieutenant Governor Kay IveyLee Styslinger IIICongressman Mike RogersFormer Congressman Jack EdwardsState Senator Cam Ward, Co-Chair of the Alabama Legislative Steering CommitteeState Representative Phil WilliamsState Representative Lesley VanceState Representative Steve HurstState Representative Randy WoodAmbassador Bill CabanissMary Scott Hunter, Alabama State Board of EducationRichard Bollinger, Councilman, Montgomery, ALJeff Peacock, Alabama Republican Party Vice Chair, Districts 1, 2Sue Neuwien, Alabama Republican Party District 2 ChairMarty Connors, Former Alabama Republican Party Chairman
