Mitt Romney today announced the support of 40 recipients of the Medal of Honor."Of all the heroes that have served in our armed forces, only a few have had the great privilege of receiving the Medal of Honor," said Mitt Romney. "They are the best of us all, and their dedication to our freedoms and their fellow servicemen and women serves as a shining example to every American. I am deeply honored and grateful to have the support of so many of these brave men, but my deeper thanks is for their service to this nation.""I have dedicated much of my life to the service of my country, and I want it to be in good hands for the next four years and beyond," said Medal of Honor recipient Leo Thorsness. "In Mitt Romney, I believe we have a leader who can address the problems we face, while restoring America to its place on the world stage. Governor Romney understands the needs of our servicemen and women, and he will ensure that those who have fought for us abroad will not have to fight for a good job and good healthcare when they come home. We need that sort of leadership in the White House."Medal of Honor Recipients Endorsing Mitt Romney:Don BallardHarvey BarnumGary BeikirchPat BradyJon CavaianiBruce CrandallSammy DavisGeorge "Bud" DayRoger DonlonWalter EhlersFrederick FergusonMichael FitzmauriceJames FlemingWesley FoxHarold FritzCharles HagemeisterTom HudnerRobert IngramJoe JacksonAllan KelloggGary LittrellJames LivingstonAllen LynchWalter MarmRobert MaxwellJohn McGintyHiroshi MiyamuraLee MizeRobert ModrzejewskiThomas NorrisRobert PattersonRichard PittmanAlfred RasconRonald RosserKenneth StumpfJames TaylorMichael ThorntonLeo ThorsnessJay VargasHershel Williams
