Mitt Romney today announced his Wisconsin County Chairs."After three years of stagnant economic growth and reckless spending, it is clear to Wisconsin voters and voters across the country that we need a conservative leader and proven job creator as president," said Mitt Romney. "That is why I am running and it is why I will need the help of my Wisconsin County Chairs to defeat President Obama in November."Former Wisconsin State Senator Ted Kanavas said, "Our Wisconsin campaign will need the hard work of our county chairs to defeat President Obama in November. Wisconsin can't afford four more years of President Obama. Mitt Romney is the only candidate who can stop the over-spending in Washington, bring jobs back to the state, and restore our place in the world."Mitt Romney's Wisconsin County ChairsAdams County — Logan and Barbara MaybeeAshland County — William BlakeBarron County — Adam CandlerBayfield County— Ken JohnsonBrown County — Jess GavicBuffalo County — Larry BalkBurnett County — Gary MarekCalumet County — Brendon SmithChippewa County — Terri LukeClark County — Virginia ReisColumbia County — Paul NelsonCrawford County — Michael PetersonDane County — Lee Gasper-GalvinDane County — Jo AtkinsonDodge County — Lucinda WagnerDoor County — Stephaine SoucekDouglas County — Donna PavlovichDunn County — Sharon WilkinsEau Claire County — Jason LaufenbergFlorence County — Barbara DagostinoFond du Lac County — James SennForest County — Raymond BauerGrant County  — Andrew HeimanGreen County — Jegerlehner MarilynGreen Lake County — Nancy and Phillip SpencerIowa County — Douglas PimentelIron County — Tanner HillerJackson County—   Robert EddyJefferson County—   Betsey DeloreyJuneau County — Carrie DutscheckKenosha County — Matthew HolmesKewaunee County— Natalie HollidayLa Crosse County — Lauren Ann RehrauerLafayette County — Pearl SoperLanglade County — Devin GattonLincoln County — Patricia HellerManitowoc County — Maria ForsterMarathon County — Marlene KrenzMarinette County —   Arleen MessengerMarquette County — Roberta BrownMenominee County — Michael EldridgeMilwaukee County — Francesca WoodMilwaukee County — Julie KossMonroe County — Grace KonishOconto County — Philip BayeOneida County — Margaret MoyerOutagamie County — Doris HeissOzaukee County — Richard JanezicPepin County— Irene SchuhPierce County — Conrad FunkPolk County — Joyce AndersonPortage County — Virginia WentzelPrice County — Karl MoravekRacine County — Andrew SchonertRichland County — Merna QueenRock County—   Ben FoxRock County — Tony WickershamRusk County — Eleanor MeadSauk County—   Brandon WegnerSawyer County — Jim MillerShawano County — William HawleySheboygan County — Marlin MillerSt. Croix County — Shirley StrobushTaylor County — Robert DornTrempealeau County — Julie HallamVernon County Robert LambertVilas County — Joyce MitchellWalworth County — Bonnie AllegrettiWashburn County — Lennette SveinssonWashington County — Brittany FitzpatrickWaukesha County — Corey WurtzbacherWaukesha County — Candee ArndtWaupaca County — Fred ZaugWaushara County — Patricia MillerWinnebago County — Frank MicaleWood County — Leon Schmidt
