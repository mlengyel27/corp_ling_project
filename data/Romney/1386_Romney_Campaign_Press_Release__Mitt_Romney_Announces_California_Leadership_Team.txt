Mitt Romney today announced his California Leadership Team."It is an honor to have so much support from such distinguished leaders in California," said Mitt Romney. "This is further proof that my pro-growth message is resonating with voters and that Californians want a conservative businessman to replace President Obama. I look forward to their counsel in my efforts to bring back jobs and restore fiscal sanity in Washington."Announcing Mitt Romney's California Leadership Team, former Governor and Romney California Honorary Co-Chairman Pete Wilson said, "This election is too important for our party to nominate a candidate without the real-world economic experience and proven track record that Mitt Romney has demonstrated throughout this campaign and throughout his life. The members of his California Leadership Team have already been hard at work spreading his pro-growth message and working to ensure that President Obama is defeated in November. I am proud to be a part of this team and encourage my fellow Republicans to unite behind the one candidate we know can beat President Obama and create an economic climate that will bring jobs back to California."Mitt Romney's California Leadership Team:Statewide Honorary ChairmenGovernor Pete WilsonGovernor George DeukmejianStatewide ChairsMeg WhitmanHouse Majority Whip Kevin McCarthyCongressman Darrell IssaCongresswoman Mary Bono-MackCongressman Buck McKeonState Senator Tony StricklandCarly FiorinaStatewide Co-ChairsCongressman Brian BilbrayCongressman Ken CalvertCongressman John CampbellCongressman Jeff DenhamCongressman Wally HergerCongressman Jerry LewisCongressman Dana RohrabacherState Senate Republican Leader Bob HuffAssembly Republican Leader Connie ConwayState Senator Sam BlakesleeState Senator Bob DuttonState Senator Sharon RunnerState Senator Mark WylandAssemblyman Paul CookAssemblyman Jim SilvaBill SimonStatewide Steering CommitteeState Senator Tom BerryhillState Senator Anthony CannellaState Senator Bill EmmersonState Senator Jean FullerState Senator Ted GainesState Senator Tom HarmanState Senator Mimi WaltersAssemblyman Curt HagmanAssemblyman Kevin JeffriesAssemblyman Jim NielsenAssemblyman Don WagnerLA District Attorney Steve CooleyFormer Senate Republican Leader Dick Ackerman
