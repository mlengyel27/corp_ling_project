Romney for President today announced its Public Safety Professionals for Romney coalition. This coalition will lead an effort to increase support among the public safety community for Mitt Romney and ensure that our country is a safe and healthy place to live."I want to thank each and every one of the dedicated public safety officials that have agreed to join my team as members of Public Safety Professionals for Romney," said Mitt Romney. "Every day, peace officers from around this country put their life on the line to ensure that our citizens can live in safety. The men and women who have pledged to support me today represent the best and the bravest, and they personify the courage and fortitude of our nation's sheriffs and public safety officials. I am especially honored that Mayor Giuliani, Congressman Reichert, and Sherriff Bouchard have agreed to chair Public Safety Professionals for Romney. Their example and selfless commitment to public safety has set the standard that I will look to in this campaign and especially if I am fortunate enough to become the next President of the United States.""I am honored to serve alongside Congressman David Reichert and Sheriff Michael Bouchard as Chairman of Governor Romney's Public Safety Coalition," said former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. "The first obligation of government is to protect our citizens, and those peace officers who dedicate their lives to that honorable cause are among our most cherished heroes. The men and women who have joined Public Safety Professionals for Romney are some of the most accomplished and respected members of their profession. Together, we will help Governor Romney to not only win this year's election, but also to ensure that every city in America is a safe and healthy place to live and raise a family.""Having served as a county sheriff, I know that these brave men and women put their lives on the line every day to protect our families," said Congressman Dave Reichert. "They deserve a president who appreciates their sacrifices and understands what it takes to keep Americans safe. Mitt Romney will be that president, and together with Paul Ryan, they will usher in a new era of leadership in Washington that creates good jobs, brings down the poverty rate, and helps provide a future other than crime for our at-risk youth. I am proud to support them.""As the sheriff of Oakland County, I know something about leadership," said Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard. "That's why I am so pleased to be a part of Public Safety Professionals for Romney. Mitt Romney has governed a state, and he knows first-hand the support that we in the law enforcement community need to keep our communities safe. His record is impeccable, and I look forward to having such a great friend and ally to police officers and sheriffs in the White House."ChairmenMayor Rudy GiulianiCongressman David Reichert (R-WA)Sheriff Michael Bouchard; Oakland County, MichiganHonorary Co-ChairsCongressman Rich Nugent (R-FL)Congresswoman Sandy Adams (R-FL)National Advisory BoardSheriff John Rutherford; Jacksonville, FloridaSheriff David Gee; Hillsborough County, FloridaGraham Fountain, Director of Law Enforcement Operations; Walton County, FloridaSheriff Carolyn "Bunny" Welsh; Chester County, PennsylvaniaSheriff Joseph McGinn; Delaware County, PennsylvaniaChristopher Hailey; Mecklenburg County, North CarolinaSheriff BJ Barnes; Guilford County, North CarolinaThe Honorable Marla Graff Decker, Secretary of Public Safety, VirginiaSheriff Ken Stolle; Virginia Beach, VirginiaSheriff Jeff Grey; Mercer County, OhioSheriff Dennis Conard; Scott County, IowaSheriff John LeClere; Delaware County, IowaSheriff Ted Kamatchus, Marshall County, IowaSheriff Scott Hilliard; Merrimack County, New HampshireSheriff Craig Wiggin; Belknap County, New HampshireSheriff Christopher Conley; Carroll County, New HampshireSheriff Wayne Estes; Strafford County, New HampshireSheriff Michael Downing; Rockingham County, New HampshireSheriff Douglas Dutile; Grafton County, New HampshireSheriff Richard Foote; Cheshire County, New HampshireSheriff James Hardy; Hillsborough County, New HampshireDennis Hogan, Hillsborough County Attorney; New HampshireSheriff Gerald Marcou; Coos County, New HampshireSheriff Michael Prozzo; Sullivan County, New HampshireDan May, District Attorney; El Paso County, ColoradoSheriff David Weaver; Douglas County, ColoradoSheriff Rick Whitney; Allegany County, New YorkSheriff Adrian Anderson; Dutchess County, New YorkSheriff Tim Howard; Erie County, New YorkSheriff Don Smith; Putnam County, New YorkEd Mullins; President, New York City Sergeants Benevolent AssociationSheriff Jeff Long; Williamson County, TennesseeSheriff J.J.
