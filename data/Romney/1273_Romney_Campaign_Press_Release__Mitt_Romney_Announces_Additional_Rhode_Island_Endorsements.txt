Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Rhode Island."After three years in office, it is clear that President Obama's policies have failed Rhode Island," said Mitt Romney. "I don't accept high unemployment like President Obama does and I will work with these leaders to implement pro-growth policies that will create jobs and cut spending.""Mitt Romney has shown throughout this campaign and throughout his life that he is ready to take on the challenges facing our country," said 2010 gubernatorial candidate John Robitaille. "His bold economic plan will bring back jobs and shrink government and his experience working in the real economy should give confidence to Rhode Island job creators that they will have an ally in the White House. I urge all Rhode Islanders looking for a change in Washington to support Mitt Romney."Rhode Island Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:House Republican Leader Brian NewberryState Senator David BatesState Senator Glen ShibleyState Representative Mike ChippendaleState Representative Doreen CostaMayor of Cranston Allan FungRhode Island Republican Party Secretary Ryan LundCranston Republican City Committee Chair Bruce SaccoccioCumberland Republican Town Committee Chair Mark DosdourianExeter Republican Town Committee Chair Diane AllenJamestown Republican Town Committee Chair Amy GallagherNewport Republican City Committee Chair Rudd HallPawtucket Republican City Committee Chair Hal GibsonPortsmouth Republican Town Committee Chair Jeff PlumbProvidence Republican City Committee Chair Tara PinskyScituate Republican Town Committee Chair Theodore J.
