Today, Romney for President announced its Catholics for Romney coalition."I am honored to have the support of Catholic leaders from all over this country," said Mitt Romney. "The Catholic Church embodies all that is great about America—loving your neighbor, defending life, and helping the less fortunate to overcome poverty and rise in the world. Forming a more perfect union requires that we continue to turn these principles into reality. If I am elected president, that will be my highest priority.""As a life-long Catholic, I learned very early that we must love our neighbors as we love ourselves," said Congressman Paul Ryan. "That principle has informed my life in public service, and I am pleased to have so many leaders in the faith supporting Mitt Romney and me in this election. We understand that policymakers must target the root causes of poverty with reforms that promote economic growth and opportunity.  Free enterprise and strong communities remain the best means to promote upward mobility and help individuals escape the trap of government dependency. It is an honor to support Governor Romney as he advances solutions that champion the dignity of every human being. That is a goal that people of all faiths can support."National Honorary ChairmanCongressman Paul RyanNational Co-ChairsAmbassador Ray FlynnAmbassador Mary Ann GlendonAmbassador Thomas Patrick MeladyAmbassador Jim NicholsonAmbassador Francis RooneyAmbassador Frank ShakespeareNational Honorary CommitteeGovernor Terry BranstadGovernor Sam BrownbackSenator Kelly AyotteSenator John HoevenSenator Mike JohannsSenator Jim RischSenator Marco RubioSenator Pat ToomeySenator David VitterCongressman Steve AustriaHouse Speaker John BoehnerCongressman Kevin BradyCongresswoman Ann Marie BuerkleCongressman David CampCongressman Francisco CansecoCongressman Steve ChabotCongressman Mario Diaz-BalartCongressman Sean DuffyCongresswoman Renee EllmersCongressman Chuck FleischmannCongressman Jeff FortenberryCongresswoman Virginia FoxxCongressman Paul GosarCongressman Phil Gingrey, M.D.Congressman Frank GuintaCongressman Andy HarrisCongressman Joe HeckCongressman Tim HuelskampCongressman Mike KellyCongressman Pete KingCongressman Steve KingCongressman Jeffrey LandryCongressman Robert LattaCongressman Blaine LuetkemeyerCongressman Daniel LungrenCongressman Michael McCaulCongressman Patrick McHenryCongressman Pat MeehanCongressman Mick MulvaneyCongressman Tim MurphyCongressman Devin NunesCongressman Steven PalazzoCongressman Tom ReedCongressman Jim RenacciCongressman Todd RokitaCongressman Tom RooneyCongressman Steve ScaliseCongresswoman Jean SchmidtCongressman Chris SmithCongressman John SullivanCongressman Pat TiberiFormer Colorado Governor Bill OwensFormer Governor of New Hampshire John H. and Nancy SununuFormer Senator and Ohio Governor George VoinovichFormer Senator Rick SantorumFormer Speaker of the House Newt and Callista GingrichFormer Congressman Bob BeauprezFormer Congressman Thomas Bliley, Jr.Former Congressman Mike FergusonNational Advisory CommitteeChief Finance Officer of Florida Jeff AtwaterFormer U.S. Attorney General William P.
