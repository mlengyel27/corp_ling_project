Mitt Romney today announced endorsements in Jackson County, Mississippi."I am proud to have the support of so many in Mississippi," said Mitt Romney. "With their support, we can defeat President Obama, repeal Obamacare, and reverse the failed policies of the last three years.""Mississippi voters are looking for new leadership in Washington," said Sheriff Mike Byrd. "President Obama has had three years to turn around the economy and he has failed. Mitt Romney spent his life in the private sector growing businesses and starting others â€” we can be confident that he will put in place policies to encourage the private sector, not discourage it. I am proud to join these other leaders from Jackson County in endorsing Mitt Romney and urge all Mississippians who want to put a job creator in the White House to support him on Tuesday."Jackson County, Mississippi Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:Mike Byrd, SheriffTerry Miller, Chancery ClerkBenny Goff, Jr., Tax AssessorJoe Tucker, Tax CollectorBarry Cumbest, County Supervisor, District 1Mike Mangum, County Supervisor, District 3Troy Ross, County Supervisor, District 4John McKay, County Supervisor, District 5Robbie Maxwell, Mayor, City of PascagoulaTommy Fortenberry, Mayor, City of GautierPrevious Mississippi Leaders Endorsing Mitt Romney:Gov.
